# System-Analysis-and-Desgin

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

       The Driverpass project is a website that can host materials to help students pass the driving test. The system should be able to host different courses that the students can take online and recieve feedback. The system also allows for students to schedule in person driving lessons. Laslty the system should update with the DMV to have the newest testing materials.
2. What did you do particularly well?

    One thing I did well was identify the function and nonfunctional requiremnts of the sytem. Identifying both is important, it can help the devolpers identify the most important parts of the system.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    One area I would want to revise is my gnatt chart. I would want to revise it because I had issues with making it and after completing the projects and using lucidchart more, I would be able to improve it. I would improve it by using lucidchart and using the feedback I got from my instructor.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    One way I interperted the users needs was by reading a transcrpit of the users wants and needs. In an interview, the client told the  team the idea behind DriverPass and what they wanted the system to do. It is important to know what the client wants because it is their system you are working on, and there are some things they may need to have in their system.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    One way I approach desgining software is by breaking it up into diffrent tasks. Being organized help me manage the workload of the project. Using a gnatt chart is a resource I will want to use in the future because it shows the deadlines for different tasks. Another strategy I would want to use is the SDLC as a whole. The SDLC is great because it provides a step by step proces how software desgin should go.
